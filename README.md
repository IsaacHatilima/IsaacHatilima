# About Me

I am a passionate and results-driven **Software Engineer** with a diverse background in building and maintaining web applications. With experience spanning from **2019 to 2023** in backend development, and as a **Full-Stack Developer** since 2024, I specialize in creating robust, scalable applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

## Experience

### Backend Engineer (2019 - 2023)
Over the course of my career as a backend engineer, specifically with **Python Django** and **PHP**, along with front-end technologies. During this period, I worked on several projects that involved creating efficient APIs, working with databases, and designing data models.

### Full-Stack Developer (2023 - Present)
In 2024, I transitioned into a **Full-Stack Developer** role, expanding my skillset to include both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies. I have been working extensively with the **PHP Laravel ecosystem**, including **Laravel**, **Blade**, **Eloquent ORM**, and other tools in the ecosystem to build modern, performant web applications.

## Technologies & Tools

### Back-End:
- **PHP** (Laravel) (Current working stack)
- **Python** (Django, Flask)

### Databases
- **MySQL**,
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis**

### Front-End:
- **React.js**
- **Livewire**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Inertia.js**
- **Alpine.js**
- **JavaScript**,
- **HTML**,
- **CSS**

### Other Tools & Libraries:
- **Git**,

### DevOps/Infrastructure
- **Proxmox**
- **Ansible**
- **Terraform**
- **Docker Swarm**
- **Kubernetes** (Currently learning)


## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. My experience across multiple programming languages and frameworks has taught me the importance of understanding the full development cycle — from design and architecture to deployment and scaling. I am always excited about learning new technologies and approaches, and I'm deeply invested in best practices for both development and testing.
